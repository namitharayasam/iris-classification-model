# Iris-Flower-Classification-Machine-Learning 

The mini-project for end semester 

This is a simple Iris classification model built using Scikit-Learn tools. The model is trained to classify Iris flowers into different species - Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa, and Iris Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The libraries and algorithm used:

1. Pandas
2. Train-Test Split (from sklearn.model_selection)
3. Classification Report (from sklearn.metrics)
4. Confusion Matrix (from sklearn.metrics
5. Standard Scaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (from sklearn.neighbors)
