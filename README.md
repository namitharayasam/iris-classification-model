Iris Classification Model
This is a simple Iris classification model built using Scikit-Learn tools. The model is trained to classify Iris flowers into different species - Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa, and Iris Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The libraries and algorithm used:

1. Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. Train-Test Split (from sklearn.model_selection): This is used to split your dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.
3. Classification Report (from sklearn.metrics): It provides a summary of classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
4. Confusion Matrix (from sklearn.metrics): A confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
5. Standard Scaler (from sklearn.preprocessing): This is used to standardize the features of your dataset by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
6. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (from sklearn.neighbors): K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a classification algorithm used for pattern recognition.
